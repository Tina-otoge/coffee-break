# ☕ coffee break
A score card generator for rhythm games

coffee break is a client-server application to generate a score card of any rhythm game inspired by [eAMUSEMENT](https://p.eagate.573.jp) score cards for arcade rhythm games.

coffee break wants to be suitable for any game, and exposes an easy to use API to be integrated in other services such as bots or games themselves.

It turns simple HTTP requests to the API into beautiful and very customizable
scorecards for you to use in your own score server, game, or social medias.

# Example

```js
