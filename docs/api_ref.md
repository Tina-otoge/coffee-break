# API Reference

## Endpoints

Coffee Break exposes some endpoints to either display or register scorecards.

All endpoints accept both GET and POST requests and behave the same on both.

All the parameters are the same for all endpoints and are described in the
[Parameters](#parameters) section.

### Generate picture

Routes: `/api/generate`, `/api/card.jpg`

Note: The .jpg route can be more convenient with some browsers, as it is more
likely to trigger caching systems.

Accepts params: YES

The returned content is the scorecard and has a mimetype of `image/jpeg`.

### Generate HTML

Route: `/api/card.html`

Accept params: YES

The returned content is the HTML of the scorecard, the one used to generate the
image. This is useful to inspect the different classes and styling elements.

### Register scorecard

Route: `/api/register`

Accept params: YES

Saves the request to the database and returns a JSON object with the ID and the
link of the saved request, in the form:
```js
{
	"id": <ID here>,
	"url": <URL here>
}
```

The URL can be used to [retrieve a registered scorecard](#retrieve-scorecard).

### Retrieve scorecard

Route: `/api/cards/<ID>.jpg`

Accept params: NO

Generates the picture of a previously registered scorecard. The behaviour is the
same as the [Generate picture](#generate-picture) route, except that instead of
taking parameters, the one sent when registering the card are used instead.

### Example scorecards

Example requests are available for reference in the `/examples/requests` folder
at the root of the repository. They can be used to generate pictures or HTML
using the `/api/examples/<example_name>` and `/api/examples/<example_name>.html`
routes respectively.

Accept params: NO

## Parameters

All the accepted parameters are defined and described in the `/coffeebreak/params.py`
file. Please refer to the file for an up-to-date documentation.

All parameters are **optional** and can be omitted freely without breaking the
scorecard generation.

### Styling

The `class` parameter is a special JSON object passed in the request that can be
used to apply custom styles to the scorecard. It can apply predefined classes to
other elements.

For example, to turn the difficulty name into the color red, the value
`{"difficulty": "red"}` can be used.

#### Classes

Here is a list of the available classes.

Name | Description
-----|------------
gold, red, orange, light-orange, yellow, lime, green, blreen, blue, ocean, purple, mangenta, pink | Apply a color
bg-gold, bg-red, bg-orange, bg-light-orange, ... | Apply a background color
rainbow | Apply a rainbow effect to the text
bg-rainbow | Apply a rainbow effect to the background
borders | Add borders
big-borders | Add bolder borders
rounded-borders | Makes the borders rounded
round | Tries to make the borders round enough to be a circle (looks weird on non-squares)
contain | Always fits picture inside their container, while maintaining ratio

#### Stylable elements

Here is a list of the elements that can be styled

Name | Description
-----|------------
background_color | Special element, takes a color instead of a class
background_image | Special element, takes an URL instead of a class
avatar |
rank |
difficulty |
level |
clear_type |
clear_types | JSON object of mapping of clear type names to classes, ie: `{"class": "clear_types": {"FULLCOMBO": "rainbow" }}`
hp |
grade |
grades | JSON object of mapping of grade names to classes, ie: `{"class": "grades": {"SSS": "gold" }}`
score |
judges | JSON object of mapping of judge names to classes, ie: `{"class": "judges": {"PGREAT": "rainbow"}}`


### Settings

Special settings can be enabled using the `settings` parameter. They provided
minor logic to calculate some stuffs before generating the card. Most of the
settings will try to modify the default values when applied, meaning that the
actual parameters always take priority.

For example, to automatically fill the `date` parameter with the current time,
the value `{"auto_date": true}` can be used.

#### List of settings

This is the list of the settings that can be used

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
preset | string | Apply default values to match the style of certain games. Supported values: `"osu!"`, `"IIDX"`. See `/coffeebreak/presets.json` for the actual values. Submit a PR to add more.
auto_combo | any | Calculates `max_chart_combo` by summing all `judges` values.
auto_date | any | Fills `date` with the current date
auto_fc | any or JSON object | Sets `clear_type` to `"FULLCOMBO"` if `breaks` = 0 or `judges.MISS` = 0, otherwise, sets `clear_type` to `CLEARED`. See below for how those values can be customized by using a JSON object.
auto_fc.miss | string | Overrides the judge name for misses to look for when checking for 0 miss
auto_fc.fc | string | The value to use in `clear_type` if there are 0 miss
auto_fc.not_fc | string | The value to use in `clear_type` if there is 1 or more miss
